After looking through the code before putting it on GitHub, I've decided to write my thoughts down.

I guess you could say this is a post-mortem, or retrospective, or something.

* I taught myself Python by writing this, so this code isn't "pythonic" in nature. 
  * Maybe writing a game isn't really the best way to learn Python?
  * I came from a C++/Java/C# background, so I wrote this code using the thought-patterns from those languages.
    * Part of it came from porting the C++ prototype of this game to Python.
* This was really fun project to work on, too bad we stopped working on it (Pop a Dots as a whole).
* I'm actually proud of this.
* Doge memes are still cool. wow
* I'm releasing this for educational purposes so that people can learn something.
  * Like maybe this code sucks lmao
  * or how to make a game in PyGame
* Not making excuses for myself, but I started working on this in 2014. Just saying.
* Trying to package a release for a python application sucks!
